<h3>Dear Reader . . .</h3>

<p>As you may have noticed, we here at Healthy Aging® are cheerleaders for encouraging others to think positively, see the best in themselves and those around them, and constantly seek ways to improve.</p>

<p>Our mantra holds steady as we enter the fall season, kicked off by September, which is Healthy Aging® Month, the national observance we started in 1992 and which continues to grow stronger each year. It even has its own hashtag: #healthyagingmonth!</p>

<p>When we launched the campaign, “healthy aging” wasn’t something people openly wanted to talk about. Fast forward to today and the old stereotypes of aging are being chipped away by many who refuse to give in to frailty and decline if they can help it. Just look at the National Senior Games—participation has grown nearly fivefold since they began in 1987.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, people often thought that aging meant decline. Today, more and more of us are speaking about aging with optimism. In a recent survey, more than half of Americans over age 30 say they are mostly or somewhat optimistic about aging—and that optimism often increases with age. “70 is the new 40?” … why not!</p>

<p>The rise of social media and digital connections also plays a role. Older adults who actively post online report a greater sense of being “in touch”—still contributing, visible, and relevant. Why, today, #HealthyAging has more than 1.1 million posts on Facebook alone—a sign of how far the conversation has come!</p>

<p>Representation matters, too. We now have role models, public figures, and everyday people showing that growing older can also mean growing wiser, more intentional, and more connected. It’s encouraging to see this shift.</p>

<p>With that positive change in perception in mind …</p>

<p>Our theme for this fall is reinvention. It’s never too late—not only to reinvent yourself, but also to refine the skills and qualities you already have.</p>

<h3>Ray Lewis, NFL Legend Kicks Off the Issue</h3>

<p>Our cover feature, NFL legend Ray Lewis, exemplifies the Healthy Aging® message. The idea of featuring Ray came about, as so many of my life’s experiences have, serendipitously.</p>

<p>As we were working on cover selections in late July, I received an email from Carolé Dacey-Young, Advisor, NFL Alumni Health, about an event during Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week: Legends of Longevity: Ray Lewis & Emmitt Smith on Thriving Beyond the Game. The gathering brought together two NFL Hall of Famers—now advocates, caregivers, and wellness champions—for a heartfelt conversation on aging with intention, community, and strength.</p>

<p>Perfect timing, I said!! There could not be a better storyline for Healthy Aging®. The incredible Ray Lewis built a football career that few could match—leading with intensity, heart, and an unmistakable presence on and off the field. Fans remember not just his tackles, but the passion he brought to every game, rallying teammates and crowds alike. Though he retired in 2013, his influence still ripples through the sport, with the Ravens retiring his number 52 jersey as a tribute to his unmatched legacy.</p>

<p>In his own words: “I didn’t want just to leave the field. I wanted to leave a legacy. Now, it’s not about what I won on the scoreboard—it’s about what I can give back to others, what I can do to help people understand that strength isn’t just physical; it’s emotional, spiritual, and generational.”</p>

<p>With the football season ahead and Ray’s passionate, inspirational perspective, we were thrilled to feature him on our cover.</p>

<h3>What Else is Inside . . .</h3>

<p>This issue is also filled with stories that hit close to home for me. James Lavelle’s “Vitality Index” intrigued me because, like many of you, I’ve often wondered how to measure the intangibles—purpose, joy, fulfillment—that truly shape how we age. His framework offers a fresh way to look at quality of life.</p>

<p>Birthdays! We love them, and we have a terrific article about how to make the most of them no matter what your age.</p>

<h3>New Cookbooks and Recipes . . .</h3>

<p>Our food pages are, once again, just delicious! The article Mexican Cuisine: Recipes, Memories, and Modern Voices was inspired by the new cookbook In Edith’s Kitchen: Recipes from My Mostly Mexican-American Home to Yours. Written by rising culinary star Edith Gálvez, the book stirred memories of visits to Olvera Street in Los Angeles when I was a little girl, where the scent of tamales and fresh tortillas made me feel transported.</p>

<p>We share several recipes from Edith’s beautifully photographed book—including how to make your own flour tortillas. And don’t miss the spectacular Chocoflan Bundt Cake—it looks like it came from a pastry shop but can be made at home by mere mortals.</p>

<h3>Reinvent Through Travel</h3>

<p>And then there’s travel—one of my favorite forms of reinvention. Don’t let those travel dreams stay in the dream category . . . Act on them!</p>

<p>This issue is also full of ideas, insights, and inspiration to help you reimagine your next chapter.</p>

<p>At Healthy Aging®, we believe reinvention isn’t about becoming someone new—it’s about leaning into the very best of yourself, no matter your age.</p>

<h3>Share Your Story!</h3>

<p>I’d love to hear your own reinvention story. What have you changed—or hope to change—that’s brought new energy to your life? Share it with us, @info@healthyaging.net and it might inspire a future issue.</p>

<p>Here’s to your health, your reinvention, and a fall filled with fresh possibilities.</p>
