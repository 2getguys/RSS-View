    <p>What if America’s 63 million caregivers had access to extended family leave to take care of loved ones, more respite care to give them a break and financial flexibility that could ease the burden of paying for supplies and care?</p>
    <p>With AARP’s support, a wave of state-level policy changes to backstop caregivers has been making those resources a reality, as lawmakers acknowledge the strain on those caring for loved ones.</p>
    <p>This year, several states, including Vermont and Tennessee, expanded their job-leave programs to ensure caregivers don’t need to sacrifice income to take time for a loved one. Other states, like South Carolina, Ohio and Iowa, have given nursing home residents more financial flexibility to help pay for everyday needs.</p>
    <p>And lawmakers in Maine and Wisconsin broadened eligibility for respite care programs this year, making it easier for families to afford part-time assistance and other services that support home-based care.</p>
    <p>“Momentum at the state level, I think, speaks to where the country is at broadly, even as partisanship at the federal level really makes progress difficult on a lot of those [initiatives],” says Jaimie Worker, senior director of policy and research at Caring Across Generations.</p>
    <p>It’s not a moment too soon: Demands on caregivers have grown dramatically in recent years. The number of adults who provide ongoing care to adults or children with a medical condition or disability increased 45 percent over the past decade, according to the "2025 ﻿Caregiving in the U.S." report.</p>
    <p>Caregivers are doing more than ever: They provide more complex care for longer periods of time with limited outside help. Nearly 70 percent of working-age caregivers have a job at the same time.</p>
    <p>“It’s physically taxing, it’s emotionally taxing and, of course, socially taxing. It’s financially taxing,” says Mary Beth Malamatos, a caregiver for her 88-year-old mother in Florida. “There are stressors from all directions, and there’s no easy answer.”</p>
    <h3>Modernizing caregiving leave</h3>
    <p>In an effort to expand access to caregiving leave, several states have modernized their laws to make them more inclusive of nontraditional relationships between caregivers and care receivers.</p>
    <p>This spring, Vermont expanded its benefit of 12 weeks of job-protected leave to include domestic and civil partners, grandparents and grandchildren and similar parent-child relationships.</p>
    <p>“A lot of times, we have bills on the books that just aren’t equitable for today’s world, and so it excludes a lot of people,” says Vermont State Rep. Emilie Krasnow, the bill’s sponsor. “Our current unpaid family leave policies left people out that were in nontraditional family structures.”</p>
